# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is an extremely simple webpage that lists some beginner notes about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

I built this project because I wanted to see how VS Studio Code, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all fit together.

This project will be useful to look back on once I become a professional programmer. It will remind me how far I have come in my knowledge and skills.

This simple webpage provides a starting point for people interested in learning a tiny bit about coding.

From this project I learned some HTML, some CSS, and how to go through parts of the Git workflow.
